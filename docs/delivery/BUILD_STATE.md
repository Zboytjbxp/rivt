# RIVT Build State

Last updated: 2026-06-18 America/New_York
Current gate: Gate A foundation
Current phase: Packet 00 implementation and CI complete; review, merge, and deployment evidence pending
Repository branch: `codex/gate-a-foundation`
Base commit: `99be82a Align public brand copy with RIVT tagline`

## Working Tree

The branch contains committed Packet 00 work plus pre-existing product changes that remain preserved:

- Pre-existing Shop Talk/Trade News work: `server/index.js`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/features/network/NetworkHub.tsx`, `src/styles.css`
- Packet 00 safety work: auth/session/API hardening, dependency fixes, tests, and delivery documentation
- Product source of truth: `RIVT_MASTER_BUILD_PROMPT.md`

Do not discard or overwrite the pre-existing Trade News work when committing or splitting this packet.

## Implemented Locally

- Removed browser-side fabricated authentication and session-storage auth fallback.
- Failed login/network requests remain signed out; local guest access is disabled.
- Private legacy API routes now require a valid database-backed user session and scope records to the authenticated user ID.
- Signup, login, and Google OAuth rotate the session ID; session lifetime defaults to 30 days.
- New Google users enter `pending` onboarding without a fabricated role, company, or location.
- Existing Google users retain established role/company/location; role becomes immutable after onboarding.
- Added approved-origin CORS/origin checks and baseline auth/write/upload rate limits.
- Restricted uploads to an explicit MIME allowlist and retained file-size/count limits.
- Replaced synthetic identity/Stripe success responses with honest `not_implemented` failures.
- Added safe build/dependency health output and authenticated readiness output.
- Declared `fast-xml-parser` directly and upgraded Multer to `2.2.0`.
- Added Node unit/integration tests and a Playwright fail-closed authentication test.
- Added a GitHub Actions Gate A safety workflow for build, full lint, tests, browser verification, and production dependency audit.
- Added a disposable PostgreSQL 16 CI service and cross-user authorization/session/role integration test.
- Restored explicit Contractor/Tradesperson selection inside signup while keeping role immutable afterward.
- Reduced repository lint from 59 findings to zero. Four superseded screens remain explicitly exported and deprecated for Packet 01 parity review.

## Verification Results

Run on 2026-06-18:

- `npm run build`: pass; 1,759 modules; approximately 344 kB JS and 192 kB CSS before gzip.
- `npm run test`: pass locally; 9 tests pass and the disposable-Postgres test skips because `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is intentionally absent locally.
- `npm run test:e2e`: pass; failed login stays signed out and Tradesperson signup sends the correct immutable role/company payload.
- `npm run lint`: pass repository-wide with zero errors or warnings.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: pass; zero known vulnerabilities.
- In-app Browser QA at 1280x720 and 390x844: auth page renders, signup role selection responds, narrow role copy no longer overlaps, and no console warnings/errors were observed.
- GitHub Actions `Gate A Safety` run 27802147834 for commit `e4d1815`: pass; clean install, PostgreSQL-backed authorization/session tests, full lint, production build, Playwright auth flow, and production dependency audit all completed successfully.

## Live Environment Evidence

Last checked before Packet 00 implementation:

- `https://rivt.pro/` returned 200.
- PostgreSQL and S3-compatible storage reported healthy.
- Google auth reported configured; Facebook and Apple were not configured/implemented.
- The running source revision was not exposed.

Packet 00 has not been deployed. Live behavior must not be assumed to include these local fixes.

## Remaining Packet 00 Work

1. Review and merge commit `e4d1815` from `codex/gate-a-foundation` into `master`.
2. Deploy the merged commit to Railway and record the source commit.
3. Run authenticated live readiness and smoke tests, including existing Shop Talk/Trade News behavior.
4. Record deployment and rollback evidence in `DEPLOYMENT_LEDGER.md`.

## Next Exact Task

Review and merge the CI-proven Packet 00 checkpoint, deploy that exact commit, and run the live smoke matrix. Do not begin normalized marketplace schema or new product features until Packet 00 is accepted and deployed.

## Blocking Founder Decisions

Needed before Gate A recruitment, not before finishing Packet 00:

- Pilot user count and named cohort.
- Priority Jacksonville trade clusters and configured service area.
- Support hours and escalation owner.
- Email provider and sender-domain plan.
- Whether SMS is deferred from Gate A.
- Review/dispute policy.
- Pilot retention/deletion policy.
- Legal-review owner and approval path.

## Required Handoff Format

At the end of each packet record:

1. Source commit/branch and working-tree state.
2. Requirements moved and new maturity state.
3. Files/migrations/config changed.
4. Commands/tests run with results.
5. Live/staging deploy status and build identifier.
6. Screenshots/manual acceptance evidence.
7. New risks or decisions.
8. Exact next packet/task.
