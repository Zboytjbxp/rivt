# RIVT Build State

Last updated: 2026-06-19 America/New_York
Current gate: Gate A authentication, onboarding, and profiles
Current phase: Packet 02 implemented and CI-accepted; production provider configuration and deployment remain pending
Repository branch: `codex/packet-02-auth-onboarding-profiles`
Head commit: `762bf2c Update fail-closed auth browser contract`

## Source State

Packet 00 is merged on `master` at `4c199d903683e44d17b7985272c399c6d7a6cbd6`. The checkpoint preserves:

- Pre-existing Shop Talk/Trade News work: `server/index.js`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/features/network/NetworkHub.tsx`, `src/styles.css`
- Packet 00 safety work: auth/session/API hardening, dependency fixes, tests, and delivery documentation
- Product source of truth: `RIVT_MASTER_BUILD_PROMPT.md`

Do not discard or overwrite the pre-existing Trade News work when committing or splitting this packet.

## Packet 00 Delivered

- Removed browser-side fabricated authentication and session-storage auth fallback.
- Failed login/network requests remain signed out; local guest access is disabled.
- Private legacy API routes now require a valid database-backed user session and scope records to the authenticated user ID.
- Signup, login, and Google OAuth rotate the session ID; session lifetime defaults to 30 days.
- New Google users enter `pending` onboarding without a fabricated role, company, or location.
- Existing Google users retain established role/company/location; role becomes immutable after onboarding.
- Added approved-origin CORS/origin checks and baseline auth/write/upload rate limits.
- Restricted uploads to an explicit MIME allowlist and retained file-size/count limits.
- Replaced synthetic identity/Stripe success responses with honest `not_implemented` failures.
- Added safe build/dependency health output and authenticated readiness output.
- Declared `fast-xml-parser` directly and upgraded Multer to `2.2.0`.
- Added Node unit/integration tests and a Playwright fail-closed authentication test.
- Added a GitHub Actions Gate A safety workflow for build, full lint, tests, browser verification, and production dependency audit.
- Added a disposable PostgreSQL 16 CI service and cross-user authorization/session/role integration test.
- Restored explicit Contractor/Tradesperson selection inside signup while keeping role immutable afterward.
- Reduced repository lint from 59 findings to zero. Four superseded screens remain explicitly exported and deprecated for Packet 01 parity review.

## Verification Results

Run on 2026-06-18:

- `npm run build`: pass; 1,759 modules; approximately 344 kB JS and 192 kB CSS before gzip.
- `npm run test`: pass locally; 9 tests pass and the disposable-Postgres test skips because `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is intentionally absent locally.
- `npm run test:e2e`: pass; failed login stays signed out and Tradesperson signup sends the correct immutable role/company payload.
- `npm run lint`: pass repository-wide with zero errors or warnings.
- `npm audit --omit=dev`: pass; zero known vulnerabilities.
- In-app Browser QA at 1280x720 and 390x844: auth page renders, signup role selection responds, narrow role copy no longer overlaps, and no console warnings/errors were observed.
- GitHub Actions `Gate A Safety` run 27802147834 for commit `e4d1815`: pass; clean install, PostgreSQL-backed authorization/session tests, full lint, production build, Playwright auth flow, and production dependency audit all completed successfully.
- GitHub Actions `Gate A Safety` run 27802435052 for merged `master` commit `4c199d9`: pass.

## Live Environment Evidence

Deployed on 2026-06-18 through Railway deployment `0f6a928c-02e6-4d58-b13d-f80894bb4b77`:

- `https://rivt.pro/api/health` returned 200 and identified source commit `4c199d903683e44d17b7985272c399c6d7a6cbd6`.
- PostgreSQL and S3-compatible storage reported healthy; authenticated readiness reported `runtime-schema-v1`.
- Anonymous storage, readiness, and app-state requests returned 401.
- Invalid login returned 401 and did not create an authenticated session.
- A marked disposable account completed signup, authenticated readiness/storage access, and logout; it was then deleted from production.
- Trade News returned 22 live items.
- Playwright live checks at 1280x720 and 390x844 returned 200 with the correct title/heading and no console errors.

## Packet 00 Acceptance

Packet 00 is accepted. The broader Gate A release is not approved: normalized domain persistence, migrations, real workflow authorization, backup/restore evidence, and provider acceptance remain open.

## Packet 01 Implemented

- Inventoried production in a read-only transaction without emitting PII: 2 authenticated users, 114 unowned app-state blobs, 53 generic events, and 1 unowned upload.
- Classified all legacy marketplace state as quarantined prototype data; no legacy job, person, message, review, community post, or upload becomes canonical/public.
- Added transactional SQL migrations with checksums, advisory locking, migration status, explicit rollback, and fail-closed startup.
- Added canonical accounts, auth identities, private draft profiles, organizations/memberships, 25-trade taxonomy, consent, append-only audit events, and idempotency records.
- Bridged existing and newly inserted auth users to canonical private accounts without inferring organizations.
- Added `/api/v1` request IDs, validation/error conventions, pagination primitives, actor context, and fail-closed organization-role policy.
- Added clean/snapshot migration apply, idempotent rerun, rollback/reapply, checksum-tamper, account bridge, and authorization tests.
- GitHub Actions runs 27803255310 and 27803349568 passed against disposable PostgreSQL.

## Packet 01 Release Safety

- Created Railway bucket `rivt-private` with actual bucket `rivt-private-66cklzn4qc-f` after discovering the prior app variable used a display name that did not exist in S3.
- Copied and size-verified the single quarantined legacy object into the new bucket.
- Created an AES-256-GCM encrypted logical snapshot directly in private object storage at `backups/postgres/2026-06-19T03-29-15.832Z-pre-packet-01-4c199d9.json.aes256gcm`.
- Downloaded, decrypted, parsed, and reconciled the snapshot in memory: 53 events, 114 app-state rows, 3 sessions, 2 users, 0 guests, and 1 upload.
- Stored the encryption key as a Railway secret; no local backup file or plaintext cloud object was created.
- Deployed corrected S3 variables with Packet 01 and verified an authenticated upload, S3 head request, signed download, content match, and cleanup.

## Packet 01 Production Evidence

- Source commit: `166c43a9e24af64737eed22088e0306cc6873b22`
- Railway deployment: `1188000e-374c-44db-9d32-b007bf481959`
- Merged-master GitHub Actions run 27803652474: pass
- Production readiness: `0002_domain_foundation`, two applied migrations, zero pending
- Canonical bridge: 2 accounts, 2 private draft profiles, 2 identities, 25 trades, 0 inferred organizations
- Legacy reconciliation: 114 app-state blobs unchanged
- Anonymous storage/readiness/app-state/v1 account requests: 401
- Disposable Tradesperson signup, `/api/v1/me`, object upload/download, and logout passed; all smoke records and objects were deleted

## Packet 01 Acceptance

Packet 01 is accepted. The old object-storage bucket remains temporarily as a rollback source and should be deleted only after the isolated restore drill and retention decision.

## Packet 02 Implemented

- Added migration `0003_auth_onboarding_profiles` for verification/recovery challenges, OAuth transactions, profile ownership, resumable onboarding, and device/session controls.
- Added single-use, hashed email-verification and password-recovery tokens with expiry, replay protection, resend replacement, and session revocation after password reset.
- Added Google OIDC state, nonce, PKCE, JWKS signature validation, and safe identity linking.
- Added canonical `/api/v1/me`, profile, onboarding, and session/device APIs with server-authoritative role and ownership checks.
- Added role-correct onboarding, profile editing, email verification/recovery, and session management to the frontend without restoring browser-owned account state.
- Added a Resend email adapter, pilot invitation controls, production security configuration checks, and invitation CLI.
- Preserved the Packet 02 stop condition: no job or messaging persistence was added.

## Packet 02 Verification

- Local `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm run test`, and `npm run test:e2e`: pass.
- Local PostgreSQL-backed tests skip when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is absent by design.
- GitHub Actions Gate A run `27807558330` for commit `762bf2c`: pass in 1m 12s.
- CI evidence includes PostgreSQL 16 migration lifecycle, account lifecycle/onboarding, cross-user authorization, browser fail-closed behavior, production bundle, full lint, and production dependency audit.

## Packet 02 Acceptance

Packet 02 source and automated gates are accepted. Production deployment is intentionally held until the real email sender and required Railway security variables are configured and verified. No claim of live email delivery or live Google onboarding acceptance has been made.

## Next Exact Task

Configure Packet 02 production variables (`AUTH_METADATA_PEPPER`, `APP_ORIGIN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_DELIVERY_MODE`, and the `REQUIRE_PILOT_INVITE` decision), verify the sender domain, deploy the accepted commit through the normal merge/release path, then run disposable email signup, verification, password recovery, Google OAuth, onboarding, profile ownership, session revocation, and cleanup smoke tests.

## Blocking Founder Decisions

Needed before Gate A recruitment, not before finishing Packet 00:

- Pilot user count and named cohort.
- Priority Jacksonville trade clusters and configured service area.
- Support hours and escalation owner.
- Email provider and sender-domain plan.
- Whether SMS is deferred from Gate A.
- Review/dispute policy.
- Pilot retention/deletion policy.
- Legal-review owner and approval path.

## Required Handoff Format

At the end of each packet record:

1. Source commit/branch and working-tree state.
2. Requirements moved and new maturity state.
3. Files/migrations/config changed.
4. Commands/tests run with results.
5. Live/staging deploy status and build identifier.
6. Screenshots/manual acceptance evidence.
7. New risks or decisions.
8. Exact next packet/task.
